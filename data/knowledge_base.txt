Advance Stake Dashboard
Advance Stake Dashboard has been made available from Pool page to provide users easier staking process and create a clearer and more transparent information flow.
Users will now be able to control the whole system from a single pool and automatically switch between Tiers. By increasing staking BSR amount, users can easily switch to a higher tier without waiting for the unstake time.
To know each tier level’s benefits, you may click any of the Tiers and it will display the corresponding details.

The Staking Requirements
To qualify for each tier, you must meet the minimum staking requirements with your BSR. The higher the IDO allocation pool you want to participate in, the more BSR you need to stake and in return, will also yield higher staking rewards. Make sure to stake the minimum BSR for the tier level that suits you best. 
Each tier has minimum staking requirements as per below:
Tier 1 - min 1000 BSR
Tier 2 - min 2000 BSR
Tier 3 - min 4000 BSR
Tier 4 - min 8000 BSR
Tier 5 - min 16000 BSR
Tier 6 - min 32000 BSR
Tier 7 - min 64000 BSR
Tier 8 - min 128000 BSR
A user who stakes 2500 BSR will be eligible for Tier 2 since the BSR requirement of Tier 2 ranges from 2000 to 3999 BSR. 
If a Tier 2 user who has 2500 BSR in the staking pool adds extra 6000 BSR in the new pool, he will easily become a Tier 4 user that will increase the IDO allocation and staking rewards without losing time.
Here is another example for users who will also join farming while staking in pools. Let’s say you stake 32000 BSR in Tier 6 and you have 16000 BSR + 10 BNB LP pair in farming. 
In this condition, with a total of 32000 + 16000*2 = 64000, you will have the allocation right at Tier 7 level.

BSR Staking Rewards
In addition to access to BinStarter's IDOs when you stake BSR, you will also receive staking rewards. The reward increases depending on which tier you are participating in. 
BSR staking will continue to pay out high APY rewards, where 8 different tiers are integrated with different APY rates and a standard emission calculation. We are a community project so our priority will always be our community. According to our token plan, a sizable supply of tokens is dedicated to staking rewards. Therefore, APY rates will continue at the highest emission-based level. Below are the APY in place for each tier level:
Tier 1 = 1%
Tier 2 = 2%
Tier 3 = 4%
Tier 4 = 6%
Tier 5 = 8%
Tier 6 = 10%
Tier 7 = 12%
Tier 8 = 15%

Allocation for BinStarter's IDOs
All tiers provide access to a guaranteed allocation which means that you can participate in all BinStarter IDOs. The size of the allocation varies from project to project but the higher the tier the greater the allocation available to you. 
IDO allocation multiplier will be determined by the amount of BSR you stake. The multiplier value will determine the limit of the allocation you will be eligible for in an IDO. 
Pool weights equivalent per tier level are as follows:
Tier 1 - 1x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 2 - 2x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 3 - 4x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 4 - 8x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 5 - 16x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 6 - 32x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 7 - 64x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 8 - 128x Guaranteed Allocation

Unstaking BSR
The lock period begins as soon as you click on the "Unstake" button. Once you have done this, the tokens will no longer be added to the Tier calculation for IDO allocations once the unstaking process starts, but you will continue to receive staking rewards during and until the unstaking process has been completed. At the end of the lock period, you may claim your $BSR back to your wallet.
When the Unstake counter is reset, the stake income will automatically stop.
If a user changes his mind and wants to join an IDO after initiating an unstake, he can cancel the unstake process and reset the duration.
Additionally, depending on which tier you are participating in, your BSR will be locked for a set period of time. They cannot be moved during this period.
Tier 1 - Lock Period 7 days
Tier 2 - Lock Period 14 Days
Tier 3 - Lock Period 21 Days
Tier 4 - Lock Period 30 Days
Tier 5 - Lock Period 60 Days
Tier 6 - Lock Period 90 Days
Tier 7 - Lock Period 120 Days
Tier 8 - Lock Period 150 Days

Loyalty Bonus
We will start to distribute additional BSR for our long term stakers. Reward ratio will be 1/1000 of the minimum BSR staking amount of the user's existing Tier at the time of distribution. 
First distribution will be done after 150 days in staking for a new user and he/she will continue to receive a loyalty bonus every 150days until he/she starts the unstake process no matter which Tier he/she is in.

How to Upgrade Your Tier Level
With BinStarter v5 updates, we have updated our pool system. Users may now increase their tier level by staking more BSR from a single pool and automatically switch between Tiers. By increasing staking BSR amount, users can easily switch to a higher tier without waiting for the unstake time. 
The staking feature on BinStarter is available in BSC. Staking BSR will generate rewards and will enable you to participate in a BinStarter IDO.
1. Navigate to the BinStarter App found on this link https://bsr.binstarter.io/. Click Pool from the main menu links.  
Note: Each of the tier levels has a different minimum staking requirement. The higher the tier, the higher is the project allocation limit you may purchase during the IDO.
BSR Minimum Staking:
Tier 1 - min 1000 BSR
Tier 2 - min 2000 BSR 
Tier 3 - min 4000 BSR
Tier 4 - min 8000 BSR
Tier 5 - min 16000 BSR 
Tier 6 - min 32000 BSR 
Tier 7 - min 64000 BSR 
Tier 8 - min 128000 BSR
2. From the staking section, enter the amount from the Amount field and click the APPROVE button.
3.  A popup will be displayed to confirm the approval of the BSR amount to stake. Review the transaction that you are about to make and click the Confirm button if everything is in order.

- Earned BSR
- Option to Claim Rewards with a countdown as to when you may be allowed to claim your BSR reward

Why APY is decreasing?
The APY rates are dynamic and may change over time. As more people stake their BSR, the APY rates may decrease slightly. But no need to worry - this is just a way to make sure that the supply of BSR stays controlled and doesn't get diluted.

The remaining tokens will be released based on the vesting schedule of the IDO project, but don't worry - you'll still be able to claim them from the "My Allocations" page as well.

Thanks to the BinStarter V5 update, every BinStarter tier will now come with a guaranteed allocation. While the size of the allocation may vary depending on the project, the higher your tier, the greater the allocation available to you.

Previous IDO Project Allocations
Hey there! If you're curious about previous IDO project allocations, you can find all the details you need by checking out this link: https://blog.binstarter.io/tag/ido-igo/ 
IDO allocation multipliers are determined by several factors, including the amount of BSR you stake, the number of participants in the IDO, and the total funds raised for the specific IDO. The multiplier value will determine the limit of the allocation you're eligible for in an IDO.
In case you're wondering about pool weights, here's a breakdown by tier level:
Tier 1 — 1x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 2 — 2x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 3 — 4x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 4 — 8x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 5 — 16x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 6 — 32x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 7 — 64x Guaranteed Allocation
Tier 8 — 128x Guaranteed Allocation
We hope this helps you plan your participation in IDO events with ease. Let us know if you have any other questions! 🙂"

Lottery Gleam Winners
We always announce the Gleam winners one day before the IDO event! 
You can check the winner list on our "IDO & IGO" blog through this link: https://blog.binstarter.io/tag/ido-igo/Look for the "IDO Allocations + Details" section for the specific project you're interested in and the winner list will be there for you to check out!
The number of winners we select depends on the availability of the project's allocation, but we usually pick 40-100 lucky winners!

To make sure you can participate in any IDO project, start staking BSR at least a day before the IDO since the whitelisting process for BSR stakers ends 24 hours before the event. To join the Whitelist of the IDO project you're interested in, simply click the "Join Whitelist" button on the IDO Project page at https://bsr.binstarter.io/ido/projects. For more information on participating in an IDO, please refer to this guide: https://support.binstarter.io/article/9-how-to-participate-in-an-ido.

Blockchain and purchasing method for each project's IDO is decided based on their specific needs. If you're curious about which chain will be used for the project you're interested in, head on over to this link: https://bsr.binstarter.io/ido/projects. There, you can find all the information you need to participate in the IDO, including which blockchain will be used.

Whitelist registration
In order to participate in the whitelist registration, you'll need to register your wallet address.

Slippage
If you're experiencing issues, you can try increasing your slippage to 1.1% or higher - that might just do the trick! 😉

How to upgrade to higher tier level and increase IDO pool
You can increase the IDO pool you're eligible for is by staking more BSR into a single pool and automatically moving up the Tiers. By adding more BSR to your staking pool, you can easily switch to a higher Tier without having to wait for the unstaking period. This means more opportunities to participate in exciting projects! 

What is EIP and how does EIP work?
Basically, the EIP is a specialized insurance protocol that goes above and beyond to protect our community. It constantly evaluates the project's performance during the TGE and keeps a close eye on the token price throughout the entire vesting schedule. If the token price remains below the IDO price for 5 consecutive days, the EIP kicks in and our community is directly refunded. It's just one of the ways we're working to keep our platform safe and secure for everyone involved!
If you're interested in learning more about our Extended Insurance Protocol (EIP), we've got a great blog post you can check out: https://blog.binstarter.io/eip/

What is FCFS?
Once the round for the BSR stakers with guaranteed allocation and for the Gleam winners is over, we begin our FCFS or "first-come-first-serve" sale 🙂
BinStarter offers 2 types of FCFS. The first one is open to all BSR stakers and allows them to purchase any remaining tokens if available. The second one is a public FCFS which happens only if there are any tokens left from the initial rounds. This public round is available to everyone and has no requirements. To stay updated on FCFS announcements, subscribe to the BinStarter telegram channel at https://t.me/BinStarterAnnouncement .
Please note that allocation is not guaranteed for FCFS, as it depends on how quickly you can complete the purchase. To secure your allocation, we strongly advise staking the minimum BSR and becoming part of a tier level. This will provide the comfort of a guaranteed allocation 👍
The allocation amounts for FCFS rounds are dependent on the leftover token amount from the pool sales. Because of this, we're not able to announce allocation amounts in advance.

Hey there! For the latest updates on our IDO calendar, please follow our Official Twitter account twitter.com/BinStarterio . You can also check out this link to get more information about the projects lined up for IDO: bsr.binstarter.io/ido/projects .

Absolutely! 😉 We're proud to be an insured IDO launchpad, which means that all of our projects are covered under our Insurance Protocol mechanism. If our community is at a disadvantage during the IDO/Listing process, the insurance system kicks in and our community is directly refunded.

We've also recently launched the Extended Insurance Protocol (EIP), which is a specialized insurance protocol that constantly evaluates the project's performance during the TGE and keeps track of the token price throughout the entire vesting schedule. If the token price remains below the IDO price for 5 consecutive days, the EIP is activated.
You can easily spot projects that are involved with the EIP by looking for the ""EIP"" label on the IDO Projects page, which you can find at this link: https://bsr.binstarter.io/ido/projects .
For more information about EIP and how it works, be sure to check out our blog at this link: blog.binstarter.io/eip

EIP is an Extended Insurance Protocol that protects investors in case of a project failure. If the token price of a project falls below the IDO price for 5 consecutive days, EIP will trigger and investors will be refunded their investment.

It is important to note that EIP is not a guarantee of success. It is simply a safety net that protects investors from losing all of their money if a project fails.

Deomonstrating this level of security is manifested in the refund of some of the projects, the recent ones include YachtingVerse and Alaska Gold Rush."

Thanks to the BinStarter V5 update, every BinStarter tier will now come with a guaranteed allocation. You can increase the IDO pool you're eligible for is by staking more BSR into a single pool and automatically moving up the Tiers. By adding more BSR to your staking pool, you can easily switch to a higher Tier without having to wait for the unstaking period. 

You won't miss out on participating in our upcoming IDOs if you simply click the ""Join Whitelist"" button on the IDO Project page found at bsr.binstarter.io/ido/projects.

"No, but we're excited to explore listing BinStarter on centralized exchanges (CEX) once the market picks up momentum again 👊

Our long-term goal is to ensure that everyone is satisfied with the exchanges we choose to participate in."
We're proud to be an insured IDO launchpad, which means that all of our projects are covered under our Insurance Protocol mechanism. If our community is at a disadvantage during the IDO/Listing process, the insurance system kicks in and our community is directly refunded.

We're proud to be the industry's first insured launchpad that's helping to evolve the industry. Our main goal is to ensure the safety of our community and the projects we support. To achieve this, we've created an insurance policy that protects our members' investments in case of any unfair events. In the event that the policy is triggered during a launch, our members' funds are returned, essentially a 100% refund. We also have another protection system that safeguards our community from market conditions by protecting the undistributed part of their investment.
