If the Referee has multiple staking transactions within a year then the Referrer will be qualified for a reward for each transaction.  Your reward rate will be depending on the link that you choose to share with the Referee.

What is EIP and how does it work?	Extended Insurance Protocol (EIP) is a next-level specialized insurance protocol that constantly evaluates the performance of the project in the TGE and keeps evaluating the price of the token during the entire vesting schedule, and is activated when the price of the token remains below the IDO price 5 days in a row.  Refer to this blog to learn more about EIP - https://blog.binstarter.io/eip/
What will happen if the token price remains below the IDO price for 4 consecutive days then moves upper than the IDO price for the last day and again goes below on the following day?	If the price remains higher than the IDO price for 24 Hours, the EIP will not be activated and the countdown will restart.
Let’s say I’m going to be collecting 100 tokens according to this example. I took 25 tokens in TGE and 25 tokens in the first vesting but I did not claim it, and in the next vesting period the EIP is activated, is it possible to get all my funds refunded?	In this scenario, we will get %50 since holding or selling the tokens was the investor’s choice.
Is this Protocol applicable to all the projects?	You can see the projects that are involved with the EIP sticker in the “IDO PROJECTS” section found on this link https://bsr.binstarter.io/ido/projects
Who can Benefit from the EIP?	All $BSR holders have the right to attend the IDOs with an EIP sticker

If I claimed my rewards on the 31st day, will I be charged for tax?	The early reward withdrawal tax fee which is 30% decreases by %1 per day if the reward is not claimed. Since it exceeded the number of days, there will be no tax.
How much reward will I get for the referral program?	Your reward rate will be depending on the link that you choose to share with the Referee. For detailed information, please check this page https://support.binstarter.io/article/20-referral-program
